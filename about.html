        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="candlemaking.jpg" alt="Candle Making Process" class="story-image">
        <p>EcoGlow began with a simple belief: that self-care and sustainability should go hand in hand. What started as a small idea in a kitchen — pouring natural wax into recycled jars for friends and family — quickly grew into a passion for creating candles that bring light, comfort, and peace without harming the planet.</p>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>
        <img src="candles.jpg" alt="Finished Candles" class="story-image">
        <p>Each EcoGlow candle is thoughtfully crafted from start to finish. We begin with 100% natural soy wax, which burns cleaner and longer than traditional paraffin. Every fragrance is carefully blended using essential oils and phthalate-free scents inspired by nature — from calming lavender fields to fresh citrus groves.</p>
        <p>Once the wax is poured, we let each candle cure to ensure a smooth, even burn. We use cotton wicks that are lead-free and eco-friendly packaging made from recycled and recyclable materials. Every detail is designed to reduce waste and honor the environment, while giving you a candle that feels like a little moment of care.</p>
